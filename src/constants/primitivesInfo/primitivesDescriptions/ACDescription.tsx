    Simply put, algebraic constraint is a relation between two columns, such
    that some binary operation <InlineMath math="b = \{ +, -, /, * \}" />{' '}
    (applied to each row) has most of its results within several ranges. For
    example, an algebraic constraint for a table containing ShipDate and
    DeliveryDate columns with <InlineMath math="b = \{ -\}" /> will result in
    three clusters defined by a shipping method. In this scenario outliers will
    be rows with rare events such as dockers strike, typo in address, etc. This
    task discovers all algebraic constraints for a specified operation and a
    provided table. Also, it detects and visualizes outlier rows. For more
