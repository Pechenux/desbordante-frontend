    Simply put, algebraic constraint is a relation between two columns, such
    that some binary operation b = {'{ +, -, /, * }'} (applied to each row) has
    most of its results within several ranges. For example, an algebraic
    constraint for a table containing ShipDate and DeliveryDate columns with b ={' '}
    {'{ - }'} will result in three clusters defined by a shipping method. In
    this scenario outliers will be rows with rare events such as dockers strike,
    typo in address, etc. This task discovers all algebraic constraints for a
    specified operation and a provided table. Also, it detects and visualizes
    outlier rows. For more information check{' '}
