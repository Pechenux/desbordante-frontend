  'Association rule is one of the most prominent concept of a frequent pattern mining. To mine association rules a dataset have to be presented in a transactional layout -- each record of such dataset is a unique transaction which contains items that were obtained during the transaction. At first, an AR mining algorithm defines frequently met items in a dataset, i.e. itemsets, and then constructs relationships between them according to specified confidence and support levels. Constructed relationships are binary and a single AR {X} => {Y} represents a fact that if itemset X was met in a transaction, then itemset Y can be met as well.';
